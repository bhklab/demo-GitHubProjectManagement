# demo-GitHubProjectManagement
A demo and some documentation for using GitHub as our project management tool.

## GitHub Key Concepts

- Teams: TL;DR groups of GitHub users related to a specific project or task. Teams can be nested, and have discussions built into them.
  - [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)
- Issues: TL;DR document a bug, get help, ask a question. Pretty much any reason!
  - [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) 
- Labels: TL;DR categorize issues, discussions and project board items to keep the project organized and on track.
  - [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels)
- Discussions: TL;DR get questions and input from your user base, discuss ideas for new features, clarify documentation.
  - [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart)
- Project Boards: TL;DR automated kanban; bug triage; really any project planning
  - [Docs](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
- Wiki: TL;DR long form documentation about your project including contribution rules, best practice guidelines, demo content.
  - [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis)

## GitHub Organizations
  - Organization: bhklab
    - Top level grouping for our lab; all lab members are in the organization
    - Teams within an organization to specialize people for specific tasks
      - Teams have their own discussion and project boards
      - Teams can be assigned broader permissions within a reposity
  - Repo: e.g., [CoreGx]()
     - Can be administrated by individual users or by teams
     - Have Issues, Labels, Discussions (if you enable them), Project Boards and a Wiki

  - Organization level PM tasks:
    - Aggregate cross repository tasks
    - For project managers, big picture staff
  - Repo level PM taks:
    - Organize issues into work items in your kanban board
    - Use automated kanban to close issues with Pushes or Pull Requests
